# 👋 Hi, I'm Prashanna Karmacharya

🎓 **Computer Engineering Student**  
🧭 Engineer by discipline, Explorer by mindset, Perpetual Student by choice


I build with precision, learn relentlessly, and navigate uncertainty with curiosity.  
Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my engineering foundations while expanding into **data science, machine learning, and low-level systems programming**.

I don’t just want to keep up with technology—I want to help shape where it goes next.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- 📚 Core Computer Engineering coursework
- 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms
- 📊 Python for Data Analysis & Data Science
- 🤖 Foundations of Machine Learning & AI
- 🔌 Assembly Level Programming (ALP) for Microprocessors
- 🖥️ Computer Graphics using C++

I’m also preparing to actively participate in **hackathons**, where theory meets pressure and ideas meet reality.

## 🔮 Vision

> **In the next 1–2 years, my GitHub will reflect my growth into a  
> Systems Architect who bridges the gap between hardware and high-level software.**

I believe strong systems are built by engineers who understand both **what the machine does** and **why the abstraction exists**.
